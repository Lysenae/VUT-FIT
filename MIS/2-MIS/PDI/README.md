Clone the repository as git clone --recursive <repository_link>  
### There sometimes are some issues with git not cloning submodules so please do check that there is everything cloned. It means that there are 1-2 folders in /boards/\*/lib.

You need to have PlatformIO Core installed. For building and uploading the firmware you can use either PlatformIO IDE, some plugin for your favorite IDE, use Visual Studio (hopefully) or you can use Makefile / commands written in the Makefile.

Strip (Sonoff) implementation is yet missing.

Schematics are made with tool Fritzing, it can also provide electrical schematic instead of this user-friendly one.
